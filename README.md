#Project Description:
 Our main focus is to make the study method fun and easy to learn.  That's why we have created this web app.
It is a webapp where children or any age children and adults can easily learn about space,
science, technology. Our webapp carries lots of different topics to study and learn.

# NASA SPACE EXPLORATION::
We've done NASA's Open Science and Transform Ed.
Using it a user can view James Webb Telescope, Juno Park, Solar Probe etc... in 3d.  Moreover, you can know more details on this subject.
To make it easier to understand, we have added lots of animated videos.  They can also learn and watch it with the help of videos. 
Not only this, to make the study process more fun and interesting, we have also added challenging quizzes and puzzle games to our webapp.
Through this method they will show more efforts to know about this science, space and technology.  This is not the end of our project, we have many more ideas to add to this project.
