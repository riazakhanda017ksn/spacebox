       <h1>History Of Our Space</h1>
       <h4>How was the space Created?</h4>
       <p>During the Big Bang, all of the space, time, matter, and energy in the Universe was
created. This giant explosion hurled matter in all directions and caused space itself to
expand. As the Universe cooled, the material in it combined to form galaxies, stars, and
planets.</p>

       </h1>
       <p>How does the universe work? Understanding the universe's birth and its ultimate
fate are essential first steps to unveil the mechanisms of how it works. This, in turn,
requires knowledge of its history, which started with the Big Bang.</p>
<p>Previous NASA investigations with the Cosmic Microwave Background Explorer
(COBE) and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) have measured the
radiation from the universe when it was only 300,000 years old, confirming
theoretical models of its early evolution. With its improved sensitivity and resolution,
ESA's Planck observatory probed the long wavelength sky to new depths during its
2-year survey, providing stringent new constraints on the physics of the first few
moments of the universe. Moreover, the possible detection and investigation of the
so-called B-mode polarization pattern on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
impressed by gravitational waves during those initial instants will provide clues for
how the large-scale structures we observe today came to be.s</p>
<div className="video">
<video src={videoOne} muted loop autoPlay></video>
</div>
<p>Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope and other observatories showed
that the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate, implying that some day - in
the very distant future - anyone looking at the night sky would see only our Galaxy
and its stars. The billions of other galaxies will have receded beyond detection by
these future observers. The origin of the force that is pushing the universe apart is a
mystery, and astronomers refer to it simply as "dark energy". This new, unknown
component, which comprises ~68% of the matter-energy content of the universe,
will determine the ultimate fate of all. Determining the nature of dark energy, 
it's possible history over cosmic time, is perhaps the most important quest of
astronomy for the next decade and lies at the intersection of cosmology,
astrophysics, and fundamental physics.
Knowing how the laws of physics behave at the extremes of space and time, near a
black hole or a neutron star, is also an important piece of the puzzle we must obtain
if we are to understand how the universe works. Current observatories operating at
X-ray and gamma-ray energies, such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory, NeuStar,
Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, and ESA's XMM-Newton, are producing a
wealth of information on the conditions of matter near compact sources, in extreme
gravity fields unattainable on Earth.</p>

<br />

<h1>How did we get here?
       </h1>
<p>How did we get here? In order to understand how the universe has changed from its
initial simple state following the Big Bang (only cooling elementary particles like
protons and electrons) into the magnificent universe we see as we look at the night
sky, we must understand how stars, galaxies and planets are formed.
There are many questions associated with the creation and evolution of the major
constituents of the cosmos. A basic question astronomers must address is, how did
the universe create its first stars and galaxies? Once these entities were created,
how did they influence subsequent galaxy, star and planet formation? This is an
important question, because these later objects are made of elements that can only
have been created by the first generation of stars.</p>
<p>It is still unknown whether the universe created black holes with the first generation
of stars or whether these exotic objects were created by the first generation of stars.
Because black holes represent the most extreme physical conditions of spacetime
and generate some of the most energetic phenomena following the Big Bang, they
are the ultimate physical laboratories for testing theories of the universe.
</p>
<img src={videoOneGif} alt="" />
<p>We now know that our universe has a "foamy" structure. The galaxies and clusters of
galaxies that make up the visible universe are concentrated in a complex scaffold
that surrounds a network of enormous cosmic voids. However, in addition to the
"normal" matter that makes up the visible parts of the universe, scientists have
discovered that there are vast amounts of unseen matter. This so-called, "dark
matter" makes up roughly 27% of the matter-energy content of the universe, while
the visible pieces account for only about 5% of the total. Clearly, if we hope to
understand the structure of the universe and the processes by which it formed and
evolves, we must first understand the distribution of this important but unseen dark
matter and the ways in which it interacts with and influences normal matter.

Though astronomers have been studying stars for thousands of years, it is only in
the past 35 or so years that they have been able to employ instruments that detect
light across the entire electromagnetic spectrum–from radio waves to gamma rays–
to peer into the dusty clouds where stars are born in our own Galaxy. If we are to
comprehend how the universe makes stars–and planets that orbit them today–we
must continue these studies with ever more powerful telescopes</p>

<h1>Solar System
       </h1>
<p>Our solar system is a wondrous place. Countless worlds lies spread across
billions of kilometers of space, each dragged around the galaxy by our Sun
like an elaborate clockwork.
The smaller, inner planets are rocky, and at least one has life on them. The
giant outer planets are shrouded in gas and ice; miniature solar systems in
their own right that boast intricate rings and moons. Scattered throughout the
solar system are small worlds like lumpy asteroids and comets and complex
dwarf planets like Pluto and Ceres.
How did our solar system come to be? Why are these objects where they are
now? Here is the series of events that made and shaped our solar system, to
the best of our knowledge, pieced together from space missions, Earth-based
observations, and complex simulations by scientists trying to figure out our
place in space</p>

<img src={videoOneGif2} alt="" />
<p>Our planetary system is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way
galaxy. Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything
bound to it by gravity – the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto; dozens of
moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. Beyond our own
solar system, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting
other stars in the Milky Way.

<h1>The History of 
Planet Earth
       </h1>

<li>The history of Earth concerns the development of planet Earth from its formation to the present
day.[1][2] Nearly all branches of natural science have contributed to understanding of the main events
of Earth's past, characterized by constant geological change and biological evolution.
</li>

<li>The geological time scale (GTS), as defined by international convention,[3] depicts the large spans of
time from the beginning of the Earth to the present, and its divisions chronicle some definitive
events of Earth history. (In the graphic, Ma means "million years ago".) Earth formed around 4.54
billion years ago, approximately one-third the age of the universe, by accretion from the solar
nebula.
[4][5][6] Volcanic outgassing probably created the primordial atmosphere and then the ocean,
but the early atmosphere contained almost no oxygen. Much of the Earth was molten because of
frequent collisions with other bodies which led to extreme volcanism. While the Earth was in its
earliest stage (Early Earth), a giant impact collision with a planet-sized body named Theia is thought
to have formed the Moon. Over time, the Earth cooled, causing the formation of a solid crust, and
allowing liquid water on the surface. In June 2023, scientists reported evidence that the planet Earth
may have formed in just three million years, much faster than the 10−100 million years thought
earlier.[7][8]
</li>

<li>The Hadean eon represents the time before a reliable (fossil) record of life; it began with the
formation of the planet and ended 4.0 billion years ago. The following Archean and Proterozoic eons
produced the beginnings of life on Earth and its earliest evolution. The succeeding eon is the
Phanerozoic, divided into three eras: the Palaeozoic, an era of arthropods, fishes, and the first life on
land; the Mesozoic, which spanned the rise, reign, and climactic extinction of the non-avian
dinosaurs; and the Cenozoic, which saw the rise of mammals. Recognizable humans emerged at
most 2 million years ago, a vanishingly small period on the geological scale.</li>

<div className="video need-mt">
<video src={video2} muted loop autoPlay></video>
</div>
<li>The earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth dates at least from 3.5 billion years ago,[9][10][11] during
the Eoarchean Era, after a geological crust started to solidify following the earlier molten Hadean
Eon. There are microbial mat fossils such as stromatolites found in 3.48-billion-year-old sandstone
discovered in Western Australia.
[12][13][14] Other early physical evidence of a biogenic substance is
graphite in 3.7-billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in southwestern Greenland[15] as
well as "remains of biotic life" found in 4.1-billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.[16][17] According
to one of the researchers, "If life arose relatively quickly on Earth … then it could be common in the
universe."[16]

</li>

<li>Photosynthetic organisms appeared between 3.2 and 2.4 billion years ago and began enriching the
atmosphere with oxygen. Life remained mostly small and microscopic until about 580 million years
ago, when complex multicellular life arose, developed over time, and culminated in the Cambrian
Explosion about 538.8 million years ago. This sudden diversification of life forms produced most of
the major phyla known today and divided the Proterozoic Eon from the Cambrian Period of the
Paleozoic Era. It is estimated that 99 percent of all species that have ever lived on Earth, over five
billion,[18] have gone extinct.
[19][20] Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10
million to 14 million,[21] of which about 1.2 million are documented, but over 86 percent have not
been described.[22] However, it was recently claimed that 1 trillion species currently live on Earth,
with only one-thousandth of one percent described.[23]
• The Earth's crust has constantly changed since its formation, as has life since its first appearance.
Species continue to evolve, taking on new forms, splitting into daughter species, or going extinct in
the face of ever-changing physical environments. The process of plate tectonics continues to shape
the Earth's continents and oceans and the life they harbor.</li>

      <h1>What Are Stars
       </h1>
    <h3>What is a star?</h3>
<p>But just what is a star, exactly? A star is a luminous ball of gas, mostly hydrogen and
helium, held together by its own gravity. Nuclear fusion reactions in its core support the
star against gravity and produce photons and heat, as well as small amounts of heavier
elements. The Sun is the closest star to Earth.</p>
<img className='images-space' src={videoOneGif22} alt="" />
<h3>Where do stars come from?</h3>
<p>According to current star formation theory, stars are born as clumps within gigantic gas clouds
that collapse in on themselves. The cloud’s material heats up as it falls inward under the force
of its own gravity.
When the gas reaches about 10 million K (18 million °F), hydrogen nuclei begin to fuse into
helium nuclei, and the star is born. Energy from nuclear fusion radiates outward from the
center of the burgeoning star, and gradually halts the gas cloud’s collapse.
• Types Of Stars
A star’s color relies on its temperature: hotter stars emit bluer light and cooler stars emit
redder light. Temperature is also correlated to mass. Red dwarf stars have as little as 0.075
solar masses and a visible surface temperature less than 4,000 K. The most massive star known
is R136a1, a Wolf-Rayed star 265 times the Sun’s mass — its visible surface temperature hovers
at a searing 50,000 K.
The most massive (and hottest) stars exhaust their energy supply within a few million years,
while tiny and cool red dwarf stars can keep on burning for many billions of years.

</p>

<h3>Main sequence star</h3>
<p>A star the size of our Sun requires about 50 million years to mature from the
beginning of the collapse to adulthood. Our Sun will stay in this mature phase (on
the main sequence as shown in the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram) for approximately
10 billion years.
Stars are fueled by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen to form helium deep in their
interiors. The outflow of energy from the central regions of the star provides the
pressure necessary to keep the star from collapsing under its own weight, and the
energy by which it shines.
As shown in the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram, Main Sequence stars span a wide
range of luminosities and colors and can be classified according to those
characteristics. The smallest stars, known as red dwarfs, may contain as little as 10%
the mass of the Sun and emit only 0.01% as much energy, glowing feebly at
temperatures between 3000-4000K. Despite their diminutive nature, red dwarfs are
by far the most numerous stars in the Universe and have lifespans of tens of billions
of years.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the most massive stars, known as hypergiants, may be 100 or
more times more massive than the Sun, and have surface temperatures of more
than 30,000 K. Hypergiants emit hundreds of thousands of times more energy than
the Sun, but have lifetimes of only a few million years. Although extreme stars such
as these are believed to have been common in the early Universe, today they are
extremely rare - the entire Milky Way galaxy contains only a handful of hypergiants.</p>

<img className='images-space' src={videoOneGif23} alt="" />
<br />



<h3>Stars and their fates </h3>
<p>In general, the larger a star, the shorter its life, although all but the most massive
stars live for billions of years. When a star has fused all the hydrogen in its core,
nuclear reactions cease. Deprived of the energy production needed to support it,
the core begins to collapse into itself and becomes much hotter. Hydrogen is still
available outside the core, so hydrogen fusion continues in a shell surrounding the
core. The increasingly hot core also pushes the outer layers of the star outward,
causing them to expand and cool, transforming the star into a red giant.
If the star is sufficiently massive, the collapsing core may become hot enough to
support more exotic nuclear reactions that consume helium and produce a variety
of heavier elements up to iron. However, such reactions offer only a temporary
reprieve. Gradually, the star's internal nuclear fires become increasingly unstable -
sometimes burning furiously, other times dying down. These variations cause the
star to pulsate and throw off its outer layers, enshrouding itself in a cocoon of gas
and dust. What happens next depends on the size of the core.

<h1>Comparisons Between Planets
</h1>
<h3>Jupiter Planet</h3>
<p>Jupiter has a long history of surprising scientists – all the way back to 1610 when
Galileo Galilei found the first moons beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we
see the universe.
Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more
than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.
Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and
water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red
Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.
</p>
<h3>Jupiter Exploration </h3>
<p>While Jupiter has been known since ancient times, the first detailed
observations of this planet were made by Galileo Galilei in 1610 with a
small telescope. More recently, this planet has been visited by passing
spacecraft, orbiters and probes.
Pioneer 10 and 11 and Voyagers 1 and 2 were the first to fly by Jupiter in
the 1970s, and since then we’ve sent Galileo to orbit the gas giant and drop
a probe into its atmosphere. Cassini took detailed photos of Jupiter on its
way to neighboring Saturn, as did New Horizons on its quest for Pluto and
the Kuiper Belt. NASA’s Juno spacecraft, which arrived in the Jovian
system in July 2016, is currently studying the giant planet from orbit</p>
